Some themes may not work at first, as I improvised my way to restore some of them or they may have system calls that cause trouble or certain little things such as not having an specific font.

## To know

As I don't use bars but just to enjoy them, I like them to keep them as basic and cool as they might be.

Also, as I tought that there may be people that don't like using icons as me, all of the themes use default ASCII and UTF-8 characters. If you plan to use icons, the best is to use icon-supported fonts such as some of NerdFont's.

The code quality CAN improve a lot, but seeing the license below will talk about how much I care, lmao @ you.

But I am not jerk, so if anyone have the benedict saint soul of Jesus inside them and decide to do a PR. If it is not malign, i'll be gladly open to collaborate.
